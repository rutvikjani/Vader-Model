('Coronavirus impact on energy markets',) 
['As the coronavirus spreads around the world and countries implement containment measures, energy supply and demand is being disrupted. The impact that country-wide lockdowns and demand slowdowns will have on energy markets will be evolving every day.', 'The recent slump in German wind capacity is likely to continue this year as complicated regulations and weakness in the global economic outlook due to the coronavirus are likely to dampen investment in the renewable technology.', 'This has the potential to restrict future additions to wind output, impacting supply and, in turn, supporting power prices.', 'Chinese natural gas demand from the industrial sector in March\xa0was down by almost 25%\xa0year on year, according to the Chongqing Gas and Petroleum Exchange released over Easter, as the impact of the coronavirus continued to weigh on consumption.', 'A growing number of British energy suppliers could be at risk of colllapsing\xa0through reduced energy offtake and cash-flow constraints amid the coronavirus pandemic, according to industry sources polled by ICIS.', 'Power consumption\xa0continued to soften\xa0across key European demand centres through March and the first week of April, while less stringent measures and colder weather has sheltered other parts of Europe.', 'While the coronavirus outbreak is already having a significant impact on the European renewables sector, one unintended consequence of the pandemic is likely to be the\xa0achievement of EU and member state binding renewable energy targets for 2020. This is due to the consequences of a prolonged downturn in demand, which will not be normalised for by the EU’s official statistics office (Eurostat), meaning that renewables look set to make up a higher share of consumption in 2020 across the EU.', 'Spanish power prices across the curve are expected to maintain a bearish trajectory\xa0throughout the nationwide coronavirus lockdown\xa0period which was recently extended until 26 April, with further extensions possible.', 'Nevertheless, forecasts for below-average wind generation would support Spanish spot prices,\xa0allowing France to continue exporting power to Spain. This in turn should keep Spanish near-curve contracts at a premium to their French equivalents.', 'Market sources have indicated the coronavirus has reduced\xa0demand for truck-loaded LNG\xa0around Europe, as countries have implemented lockdown measures and low oil prices have made gas less competitive as a transport fuel.', 'Data from terminals in northwest Europe shows the impact has not been as significant as originally thought.', 'Electricity consumption has leveled out\xa0in Germany, France and Italy, after falling for several weeks due to restrictions aimed at stemming the spread of the coronavirus.', 'But in Great Britain and Spain, demand has continued to drop week on week in recent days, according to an ICIS model that controls for the impact of temperature across Europe’s five largest consumers of electricity.', 'In order to assess\xa0the fundamental impact of COVID-19 on European power and carbon markets we modelled a scenario in which we accounted for the first data on dropping electricity demand as well as assumed industry production cuts and continued travel restrictions.', 'India buyers are deferring LNG cargoes\xa0as ports close operations with strict lockdowns in place. This is a concern for sellers in a long market with India one of the key buyers.', 'The combination of Brexit and lower demand associated with the coronavirus pandemic should enable the EU as a whole as well as many member states to\xa0reach their 2020 renewable targets, according to ICIS model run.', 'European power demand will continue to drop\xa0as governments escalate measures to stem the spread of the coronavirus.', 'Electricity consumption in Italy and France fell 16% below expectations over the past seven days, according to an ICIS model that controls for the impact of temperatures.', 'Three other major power markets studied by ICIS – Germany, Spain and the UK – have seen smaller drops, although all are trending down.', '• Power demand drop likely', '• ICIS model indicates 6% drop in demand during 2020', '• Price fall of 9% across Europe', 'A scenario where power demand drops one-tenth through up to June as a result of measures taken to slow the spread of the coronavirus would see power prices\xa0across European markets\xa0fall by an average 9% in 2020.', '• Temperatures across NW Europe to tumble in week 14', '• British local distribution zone demand to increase', '• EAX-NBP premium gaining', 'Incoming cooler weather across Britain for week 14 could encourage buying across\xa0NBP prompt and near curve contracts\xa0in the coming sessions. The drop in temperatures will likely trigger a spike in heating demand which has also increased due to large numbers of people working from home to curb the spread of the coronavirus.', 'Eastern European and Turkish energy companies are\xa0braced for sharp drops in demand and potential bankruptcies\xa0as countries introduce emergency measures in a bid to contain the coronavirus outbreak.', 'Although the spread of the virus is not as extensive in this region as in Italy or Spain, the impact of the emergency measures that have been taken is likely to be felt acutely because national economies are fragile.', 'Power sector demand across key European countries is\xa0set for a major slump\xa0over the coming weeks as countries scale-up their efforts to tackle the spread of the coronavirus.', 'Demand in Italy, which has been hit the hardest by the outbreak, has dropped 10% compared to its five-year average for March during the second week of its nationwide lockdown.', 'As measures to tackle the spread of the virus intensifies across other European countries, a similar drop in demand can be expected, although changes are unlikely to be uniform.', 'The impact of the coronavirus in China has reduced but gas demand will still end March well down from 2019.\xa0City-gate gas demand has been firm\xa0but the outlook for other sectors remains a concern.', '• EU-wide demand\xa0crunch could follow\xa0after lockdowns intensify', '• Residential demand to see brief increase before falling on warmer temperatures', '• LNG sellers could struggle to deliver into Europe', 'Mexico’s economy has perhaps\xa0never been more exposed\xa0to the global supply chains and commodity markets hit by the shocks of the coronavirus and the oil price war, but its president is losing time engaging in denial and political pandering. These will not help his party’s 2021 election prospects if the country’s economic performance falls further as its currency takes a beating amid capital flight.', 'Emissions of nitrogen dioxide are on the rise in China. This is an indication that economic activity is rising as\xa0businesses and industry ramp up activity\xa0with the coronavirus impact subsiding.', 'Spain is home to one third of Europe’s LNG import capacity, so a lockdown has the potential to\xa0further gum up the global LNG supply chain if, as seems likely, it leads to a drop in demand for gas and a reduced ability to support scheduled imports.', 'European nuclear power availability is\xa0expected to remain robust\xa0with strict safety measures already being implemented by the major plant operators amid the coronavirus outbreak.', 'Bulgaria’s free energy market association ASEP has\xa0called for measures\xa0to tackle national power market disruption due to the coronavirus outbreak on 16 March.', 'Heightened concerns surrounding the economic fall-out from the coronavirus is set to\xa0further weigh on European energy markets, traders say.', 'Widespread remote working due to the coronavirus is set to\xa0hit European natural gas and power liquidity, according to traders.', 'A number of firms have already asked traders to work from home or are expected to do so.', 'While some trading activities around gas and power dispatching need to be done from a trading floor, most other tasks can be done from home.', 'However, traders indicated it is unlikely to be business as normal with participants increasingly risk averse away from an office environment.', 'The coronavirus outbreak took a toll on\xa0Italian gas demand\xa0in week 11 as the government extended nationwide restrictions against the spread of the virus.', 'If restrictions continue, demand and gas prices are likely to fall further as warmer temperatures follow spring, pressuring consumption for heating. Power prices are also expected to plunge on the back of weaker gas. Gas is Italy’s main source for power generation and the marginal fuel, therefore a price maker for Italian power.', '• Coronavirus\xa0impact on LPG to worsen', '• China’s big three will have sought some LNG volume deferrals as another means by which to deal with the mounting oversupply', '• Incremental demand for gas and LNG this summer will be unusually low', 'The Italian wholesale electricity market has so far\xa0avoided major losses\xa0following the outbreak of the Coronavirus in the country, the strongest so far across Europe.', 'We provide intelligence, accelerate innovation and implement technology with extraordinary breadth and depth global insights into the big data,data-driven dashboards, applications development, and information management for organizations through combining unique, specialist services and high-lvel human expertise.', 'Contact us: ', '© All Right Reserved, Blackcoffer(OPC) Pvt.
